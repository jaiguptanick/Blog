<!--Here is a walkthrough of the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) room “Overpass.” If you haven’t already completed the challenge, you can do so [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/overpass).

>Hello, today we are going to solve an exciting room Overpass, which is quite different for me than other challenges. It is worth solving this room as it contains some essential Owasp Top 10 vulnerability, i.e Broken Authentication. Also, using some automated Privilege Escalation scripts like linpeas.sh makes it more interesting.

``` 
1.There is a user name james.
2.The ssh key to login via SSH.
```
Saving the Key to a file and reduce its permission using ```chmod 400 james.key ``` and then connecting via SSH:


<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>

``` 
```

```

```


Finally, We got a connection from the Box as ROOT. It was really a nice room containing many fundamentals, and I enjoyed solving it and writing its walkthrough. -->
