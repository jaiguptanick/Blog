	<h2>Box</h2>
	<div class="box">
		<p>In both layman and nerd-speak, this is a paragraph. This is a paragraph that goes inside a box! Whoa so crazy. This is the text that goes under the heading and the subtitle. Paragraphs vary in length but in school we're taught to make them at least 7 sentences or else we risk getting a C. Since the paragraph didn't have a thesis or a closing argument, it's probably a C grade paragraph.</p>
