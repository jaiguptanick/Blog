The website has a shield image as given in the challenge description as a hint.

Downloading and opening the image on the stegsolve tool give us the flag.

![dawgCTF]({{ site.baseurl }}https://jaiguptanick.github.io/Blog/images/dawg/0.png)


``` Flag- DawgCTF{ClearEdge_hiddenImage} ```

The red box in the source page looks strange,they are actually ASCII value of some text. <br />
On convering them gives the flag.

```Flag- DawgCTF{ClearEdge_uni} ```

Decoding the Vigenere Cipher using this online [tool](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher) 
<br />

![dawgCTF]({{ site.baseurl }}https://jaiguptanick.github.io/Blog/images/dawg/6.png)

Gives us the text but the flag is not accurate though we get the automatic generated key.Using the same key on the [CyberChef Tool](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)  
gives the proper flag format..

![dawgCTF]({{ site.baseurl }}https://jaiguptanick.github.io/Blog/images/dawg/3.png)


```Flag- DawgCTF{ClearEdge_crypto}```


##  Another Pcap

>The flag must be somewhere around here...

we are given a .pcap file lets open it in wireshark.
<br /> Exporting HTTP requests we got 2 files 


![dawgCTF]({{ site.baseurl }}https://jaiguptanick.github.io/Blog/images/dawg/9.png)


One of the file contain flag.txt which have flag in base64


![dawgCTF]({{ site.baseurl }}https://jaiguptanick.github.io/Blog/images/dawg/10.png)
